                <h2 class="h2">Cities Skylines</h2>
                <p>The game was launched in March of 2015 for Paradox. The gender of this game is city builder. You play off-line. </p>
            </header>
            <div>
                <p>In the Cities Skylines you start like a mayor of an empty land. You will have a budget; with this budget you will have to create different areas like the residential. In this area you will have to provide different services like electricity and water. If you ignore your neighbours, they will protest immediately and leave the city.</p>
                <div class="center">
                    <img class="margin-bot" src="./img/residential.jpg" alt="residential area">
                </div>
                <p>Obviously, a city needs more than residential areas, you will create industrial, offices, commercial, and farming areas… These areas provide your neighbours a place to work, shopping and spend their free time. </p>
                <p>When the cities grow, the neighbours’ needs will increase too. They will demand luxurious services like medical care, education, parks, rubbish collection, cemeteries…</p>
                <div>

                    <h3 class="h3">Pros</h3>
                    <p>This game has a big community that create mods and items for everybody to have access to and use. You can find very realistic features, from the tram of Manchester to the Buckingham Palace. Moreover, the company of the game, Paradox, listens to the community, and every 3-6 months they create DLCs with new features and new items, making the game develop constantly.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="h3">Cons</h3>
                    <p>I think the game needs an extra level of difficulty. The fans are waiting for a multiplayer mode. </p>

                <h2 class="h2">Hearthstone</h2>
                <p>Hearthstone is a card game created for Blizzard. The game is oriented to the universe of Warcraft. You play on-line against an opponent.</p>
            </header>
            <div>
                <p>You will have to create a deck with 30 cards. Every 3 months Blizzard introduces new expansions with new cards and rotates some of the older expansions. Currently the game is losing players for the launch of new games like Team Fight Tactics.</p>

                    <h3 class="h3">Pros</h3>
                    <p>It is a game with an easy learning curve. A big number of cards and fun decks. Hearthstone is a free game.</p>                
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="h3">Cons</h3>
                    <p>The game tends to be very stable and predictable, and it can get boring. Also, because the pull of cards is so big, sometimes it is very difficult to find the card that you need for your deck.</p>

                <h2 class="h2">TeamFight Tactics</h2>
                <p>The TFT is a game that was launched this July in beta version by Riot Games. The gender of the game is like an auto-chess. The game uses the characters of the League of Legends. You will play on-line against 7 other players. </p>
            </header>
            <div>
                <p>The player must buy the characters from a selection, these characters appear in a semi-random form. Each character has a type of classes, and when you get 3 or 9 of the same character, the character can go a level up. The core of the game is to combinate the classes of the characters, for example if you get at least 3 different characters with the class assassin, they will obtain a rise of +150% critical strike damage, if you get 6 assassins the rise is +350% critical strike damage. When you kill the NPCs of the game, it can drop an object. You can use these objects to equip your characters. </p>

                    <img class="margin-bot" src="./img/tft.jpg" alt="Teamfight Tactics battle">
                </div>
                <p>You have to place the characters in a game board, and you will be fighting against a random opponent, if you win, you take out a part of his life. If you lose, you will lose a part of your life. When you have lost all your life, you lose the game. The winner will be the player who has some life remaining at the end.</p>
